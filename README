Fixed bugs associated with sampling too many genealogies.

The latest update on github has a couple changes that should improve mixing when multiple heated chains are used. 
The default heating model has been changed with the result that the swap rate between chains will be lower. 
This will probably require a change for most users, in which the -hb option is used (if it was not before) or the -hb value is raised. 
While this may seem that swap rates will go down,  the net effect after some testing is that this improves mixing. 
Also the interval between swap attempts has been raised, as this seems to help as well.

Fixed a bug that got into the code in late may 2018 when the default
mode for updating with multiple heated chains was altered. 
This causes a distortion of the distribution of the phylogeny posterior
(i.e. when -j0 is used).  The bug was not present for the runs 
in the IMa3 paper  (Hey et al.,2018. MBE 35:2805â€“2818; doi:2810.1093/molbev/msy2162)
